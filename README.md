# WaterQualityRSLesson

This repository stores materials for a K12 water quality and remote sensing lesson plan.
The exercise is designed to take 2-3 class periods. Students mix their own samples using food coloring or take grab samples.
Then use their phones to load pictures into google colab, where simple machine learning models are built to relate reflectance
to the concentration of "chlorophyll" in the sample.
